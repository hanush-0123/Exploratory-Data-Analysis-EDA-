# Exploratory-Data-Analysis-EDA-
Here is Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) which has been done in Jupyter Notebook using python.
I have done this task using Anaconda-Jupyter Notebook where i have used python to complete this analysis,
Here are 4-5 key insights summarizing all the visualizations:
Males outnumber females in the dataset, but females have a higher survival rate, especially in higher classes.
Most passengers are aged between 20 and 40, with children and elderly being fewer; younger passengers had slightly better survival chances.
Fare paid is highly skewed, with most paying low fares and a few outliers paying very high amounts; higher fares correlate with higher survival.
Passenger class strongly influences survival; first-class passengers had the highest survival rates, followed by second and third classes.
Correlation and scatterplots confirm survival is positively associated with fare and negatively correlated with passenger class number (lower class number = higher class).
These insights collectively highlight the impact of gender, age, socioeconomic status, and ticket class on Titanic survival outcomes.
